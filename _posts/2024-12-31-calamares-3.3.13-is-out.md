## Modules ##
 - *dracut* module has more freedom to specify program options. (thanks Simon, #2401)
 - *partition* module improved some user-visible messages. (thanks Masato, #2412)
 - *partition* module re-scans available devices when selecting
   "manual" partitioning mode, avoiding a crash. (thanks Masato, #2414)
 - *partition* module can hide the LVM buttons during manual partitioning,
   if the distro does not want to support LVM. (#2413)
 - *partition* module can restrict what filesystems a user applies where,
   e.g. ensuring EFI is a FAT32 partition. (thanks Aaron, #2400)
 - *unpackfs* module supports skipping installation media if it
   is not present, e.g. depending on how the live media is booted.
   (thanks Simon, #2410)
