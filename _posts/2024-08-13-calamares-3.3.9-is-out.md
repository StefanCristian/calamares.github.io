title: "Calamares 3.3.9 released"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

A release with minor bugfixes and improvements specifically in the Arabic translation.

A reminder for distributions using Calamares with full disk encryption:
if you are using the *luksbootkeyfile* module,
it must be placed before the *fstab* module in settings.conf.  If it comes
after, then the keyfile will be missing from crypttab and the user will be
asked for their password multiple times.
