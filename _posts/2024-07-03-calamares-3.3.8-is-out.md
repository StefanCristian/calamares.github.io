A release with bugfixes in several modules (especially the *partition* module), and a new feature in *shellprocess*
and just about every place that runs commands -- that includes *contextualprocess*
jobs, *process* job modules, and other places.

## Core ##
 - nothing in particular

## Modules ##
 - *contextualprocess* see *shellprocess*.
 - *mount* module now correctly mounts luks and luks2-encrypted swap. (thanks Victor)
 - *partition* avoids a crash with specific checkbox-presets. (thanks Evan)
 - *partition* had a bug where manual partitioning on MBR systems might
   skip the installation of a bootloader, even though the visible bootloader
   combo-box showed that it would be installed. (see #2318)
 - *partition* could calculate an incorrect partition size when installing to
   very specific partition sizes, and now leaves a few more sectors for secondary
   GPT tables. (thanks Tj)
 - *shellprocess* now supports a *verbose* key (globally and per-command) which logs
   command output line-by-line.
 - *users* module defaults password salt to *yescrypt*. (thanks Lorenzo)
